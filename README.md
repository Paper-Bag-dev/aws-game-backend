# AWS Game Backend 🎮

## Overview
The **AWS Game Backend** is a multiplayer typescript game server built using Node.js and AWS microservices. It powers the real-time communication and game logic for an interactive, web-based multiplayer experience inspired by games like Gather Town and 2D RPGs. The backend efficiently manages player interactions, game state synchronization, and WebSocket communication to ensure a smooth and immersive gaming experience.

🔹 **Game Engine**: The game is powered by **Excalibur.js**, a powerful 2D game engine for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Features 🚀
- **Real-time multiplayer support** using WebSockets
- **Scalable architecture** leveraging AWS microservices
- **Client-side prediction** for smooth gameplay
- **Game state management** to handle player movements and interactions
- **Event-driven architecture** for efficient processing

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Node.js & Express** - Backend framework
- **WebSockets (Socket.io)** - Real-time communication
- **AWS Lambda & API Gateway** - Serverless backend operations
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database for game state management
- **S3 & CloudFront** - Asset storage and distribution
- **Redis (optional)** - Caching for performance optimization
- **Excalibur.js** - Game engine
